# Welcome to your Web3 toolkit!
Verida is a network of personal data owned and controlled by users. Users are incentivized to unlock their data stored on centralized platforms. Builders access this data for new exciting use cases such as trusted storage, decentralized messaging and single sign on. User's private data can be used as inputs into smart contracts, enabling connectivity to multiple blockchains.

We believe itâ€™s a fundamental human right that individuals have ownership and control over their personal data. We believe everyone has a right to control their identity through decentralisation, giving citizens control over how they interact with the digital world.

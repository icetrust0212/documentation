# Accounts and Identity

# Decentralized Identitifers (DIDs)

Verida accounts are [decentralised identities (DID)](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) created on the `Verida DID server`. A DID has a unique addresses (ie: `did:vda:0x6B2a1bE81ee770cbB4648801e343E135e8D2Aa6F`) that is controlled by an end user.

A user can identify themselves to another user or application by sharing their unique DID string.

The Verida Vault automatically creates a decentralized identity for new users. These identities can be exported and imported by providing the secure seed phrase and the DID string for recovery.

# Multiple identities

Users can have multiple identities depending on context. For example, a user may have a `personal` identity and a `professional` identity. This is easily supported (and free) as a user can simply create a new Verida account (DID) and use that to login to any application.

Itâ€™s also entirely anonymous. No information is known about the holder of the DID and no personally identifiable information is written to a public blockchain.

# DID Registry

Verida operates a centralized DID registry as a REST server ([Verida DID server](https://github.com/verida/did-server)).

As of writing, there is no suitable decentralized DID registry solution that meets the Verida networkâ€™s requirements for performace and cost. This server has been meets the [DID standard](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) and is designed to be upgradeable to a decentralized DID registry in the near future.

# Data Hosting & Control

A Verida account can control where their private data is stored, for all applications using the account. Data created by applications is encrypted with the accountâ€™s private keys and stored in off-chain private peer-to-peer databases.

The database endpoints for this application data is published as part of the accountâ€™s public DID registry information.

For simplicity, Verida provides a free testnet database that can be used by any application, however both application developers and users can take control of this data:

1. Application developers can host their own Verida Storage node(s) and configure that to be used for their application. See [storage nodes](../storage-node.md).
2. Users can host their own Verida Storage node(s) and force an application to use that server by updating their DID document with the new server endpoint

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Data stored on the Verida testnet is deleted regularly, so donâ€™t rely on that data persisting. If you need help spinning up your own dataserver for your application, please contact us.
